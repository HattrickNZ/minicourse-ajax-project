PROJECT Neighborhood Map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify 
popular locations or places youâ€™d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that 
provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).
